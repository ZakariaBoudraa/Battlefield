# Battlefield
This project is a small strategic battlefield game built in Java, which features two towers connected by a path. The goal of this game is to prevent the monsters that are spawning on one tower from reach the second one. The player can place different warriors along the path, each with unique abilities and properties, to eliminate the approaching monsters.

## Objective
The goal of designing this project is to demonstrate a solid understanding of object-oriented programming, and to apply fundamental concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It also involves implementing a graphical user interface to visualize the battlefield and interact with the game in real time.
